        <h2>How does CSS "control" HTML?</h2>
      <p class="description">If you want to write CSS that makes all h1 elements have a
        black background and white text, you would write:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            h1 {
              background-color : black;
              color: white;
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p class="description">In this example, the <span class="emphasis">h1</span> is a selector.
      It says to the browser
      "I want you to apply the rules I'm about to tell you to every h1 element."
      </p>
      <p class="description">After the <span class="emphasis">h1</span> there is a left curly
      brace <span>{</span> and at the bottom there is a matching
        right curly brace }. Everything between these curly braces will be interpreted
        as a "rule" that should be applied to every <span class="emphasis">h1</span>
        element.</p>
      <p class="description">The line of code that says <span>background-color : black;</span>
      is a <b>declaration</b>.   <span>background-color</span> is
      a <b>property</b> and <span> black</span> is the <b>value</b>
       of that property.</p>
