    <h1><b>CSS Summary and Reference</b></h1>
      <h2>How does CSS "control" HTML?</h2>
    <p>If you want to write CSS that makes all h1 elements have a
      black background and white text, you would write:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          h1 {
            background-color : black;
            color: white;
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
    <p>In this example, the <span class="emphasis">h1</span> is a selector.
    It says to the browser
    "I want you to apply the rules I'm about to tell you to every h1 element."
    </p>
    <p>After the <span class="emphasis">h1</span> there is a left curly
    brace <span>{</span> and at the bottom there is a matching
      right curly brace }. Everything between these curly braces will be interpreted
      as a "rule" that should be applied to every <span class="emphasis">h1</span>
      element.</p>
    <p>The line of code that says <span>background-color : black;</span>
    is a <b>declaration</b>.   <span>background-color</span> is
    a <b>property</b> and <span> black</span> is the <b>value</b>
     of that property.</p>
